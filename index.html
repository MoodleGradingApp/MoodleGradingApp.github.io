                    Grading is a time-consuming and redundant task, and some common complaints 
                    of Moodleâ€™s user interface are that it is clunky, slow, and frustrating. 
                    When someone wants to grade an assignment, you can enter the feedback there 
                    or pull down a CSV file, modify it and reupload. One consistent issue is 
                    redundancy, meaning similar feedback often applies to multiple students. 
                    Another issue is the difficulty graders have in modifying the table 
                    efficiently. If a grader wanted to change something globally, it would 
                    require fixing each individual entry tediously. We believe our application 
                    is crucial since it minimizes administration time and permits graders to 
                    allocate more time elsewhere.
                    <br><br>
                    With our application, we plan to make the process quick and painless. Often 
                    students make the same error, and without our app, it is tedious for a grader 
                    to modify feedback should they change their mind. We expect our application 
                    to save graders and professors time through features that allow for efficient 
                    operation and minimize busywork wherever possible. We believe our application 
                    enables professors and graders to maximize what they enjoy without the needless 
                    hassle of the current grading software.
